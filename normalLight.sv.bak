/*
Description: This module describes the states and transitions associated with the state machRe
				 State machRe has four Rput (L, R, NL, NR), and one output (lightOn). State machRes shows the next 
				 and present states of the LEDs accordRg to the states of the keys beRg pressed and present states of 
				 LEDs surroundRg center light (LEDR[5]).

Rputs:
			L, R: State of keys beRg pressed. L corresponds to left key (L = 1 when left key is pressed)
					 and R corresponds to right key (R = 1 when right key is pressed.)
 
			NL, NR: State of lights. NL is right to the left of center light and NR is light to the right. 
					  (NL =1 when left light is on and NR = 1 when right light is on).
			
			Clock: Clock frequency at 50 MHz.
			
			RST: Returns LED pattern back to chosen state. Chosen state is when all LEDS except 
					 center light (LEDR[5]) are off. 

Outputs:
			lightOn: State of center right (LEDR[5]). lightOn = 1 when center light is on.
