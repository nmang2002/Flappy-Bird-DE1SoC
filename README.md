###### In this project, the game Flappy Bird is designed and implemented using System Verilog and the DE1-SoC FPGA board. A 16x16 LED array is used to display the game. A scoreboard, random pipe generation, end screen, and gravity for bird character are all implemented. Testbenches written in files for simulation in ModelSim.
